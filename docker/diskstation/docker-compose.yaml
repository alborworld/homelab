# Main docker-compose file for the Diskstation setup
#
# NOTE: github-runner-ds is intentionally NOT included here to prevent
# GitHub Actions workflows from restarting the runner that's executing them.
# The runner is managed separately and Watchtower will still automatically update it.
#
# To manually manage the GitHub runner:
#   cd github-runner-ds
#   docker compose --env-file ../.env up -d      # Start/update
#   docker compose --env-file ../.env restart    # Restart
#   docker compose --env-file ../.env down       # Stop
