# AlborWorld's Homelab

A modular, GitOps-driven homelab infrastructure designed to provide security, privacy, and data ownership while automating and maintaining services across multiple devices.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: This repository is under active development. Expect changes and improvements over time.

## 📚 Documentation

- [**Architecture**](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Detailed overview of the homelab's architecture
- [**Setup Guide**](docs/SETUP.md) - Step-by-step instructions for setting up the homelab

## 🔐 Security

- All secrets are encrypted using [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) with age
- Encrypted `.env.sops.enc` files are version controlled
- Plaintext secrets are never committed to the repository
- See [Security Practices](docs/SECURITY.md) for details on secrets management

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:alborworld/homelab.git ~/homelab
   ```

2. Follow the [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP.md) for host-specific instructions

3. For Docker deployments, see [docker/README.md](docker/README.md)

## 🚧 Roadmap

With the number of services now approaching 50, it's time to upgrade the homelab's orchestration to Kubernetes for improved scalability, reliability, and management.

Here are some of the planned improvements and features for the homelab:

- [ ] Set up K3s cluster on pve
- [ ] Set up GitOps with ArgoCD
- [ ] Use Terraform/OpenTofu to provision VMs in Proxmox and deploy Cloudflare distributions
- [ ] Use Ansible playbooks for automated setup and orchestration of VMs, Diskstation, and Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Deploy HashiCorp Vault / OpenBao for centralized and seamless secrets management
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for infrastructure monitoring
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments
